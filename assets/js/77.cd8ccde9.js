It caches part of the traffic data when there are apparent speed differences between upstream and downstream. As a practical example, if you are downloading some videos, the speed from website to your proxy server is 500 Mbps, and the proxy server has only 50 Mbps to your home broadband. V2Ray will download the video to VPS in prior and then relay these data to your desktop computer. By default, V2Ray has a cache size of 10 MBytes per connection (the default cache is now up to 512 KBytes), which means that if the task of downloading opens 32 threads, V2Ray will cache up to 320 MBytes of data.
