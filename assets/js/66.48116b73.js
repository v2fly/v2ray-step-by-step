The reason for choosing KCP is to have a better online experience in some bad network environments. There are two reasons for using TLS: First, it is considered that TLS has the same features as HTTPS and is not easily walled; secondly, TLS has a better encryption effect and is not easily walled. For the first point, although HTTPS is based on TLS, it is not equivalent to TLS, so the same argument that TLS is the same as HTTPS is wrong; for the second point, the chance of being walled is stronger with a stronger encryption algorithm.
